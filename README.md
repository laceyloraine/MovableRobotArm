# MovableRobotArm
A movable robot arm

This is based from a common openGL programming assignment where the initial program, robot.cpp, draws a flat empty grey surface.
The programmer must determine the dimensions and necessary motion of the arm and its joints.

The control selections for the arm are as follows:
1: Move the arm's position on the grey surce
2: Rotate the base of the arm
3: Move the shoulder and elbow joints, or the first and second joints from the arm's base
4: Rotate the wrist joint
5: Move the knuckle and finger joints

Once the user choose a joint to control using a number key, he or she can move the mouse while holding down the left mouse 
button in order to move the selected joint.

ESC Exits the program
